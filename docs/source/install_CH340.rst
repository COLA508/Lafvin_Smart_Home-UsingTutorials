Install CH340 Driver
====================

The ESP32 development board in this kit uses the **CH340C USB-to-serial chip**, so you must install the corresponding driver before using it.  

If you connect the board to the computer without installing the driver, the device will not be recognized correctly, and you may see the following interface in the **Device Manager**:

.. note::

   In some cases, you may need to **restart Windows** after installation to ensure the driver takes effect.  


Checking Correct Driver Installation in Device Manager
-------------------------------------------------------

Once the driver is installed, connect the ESP32 board to your computer.  
You should see the correct name and port number appear in the **Device Manager** (for example: COM28).
