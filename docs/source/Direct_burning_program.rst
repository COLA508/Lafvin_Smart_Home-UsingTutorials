Direct Burning Program
=======================

 - Of course, if you find the above steps too cumbersome, you can also use Espressif's official flashing tool. 
We've packaged the program as a bin file, so you can flash it directly to the ESP32 development board without importing libraries or downloading the ESP32 core package, allowing you to experience the kit's features more quickly.




Install CH340 Driver
---------------------
Similarly, before using Espressif's official flashing tool, you must first install the CH340 driver so that the ESP32 development board can communicate properly with your computer. 
If the CH340 driver is not installed on your computer, click here to jump to the CH340 driver installation tutorial page. :doc:`install_CH340`.
