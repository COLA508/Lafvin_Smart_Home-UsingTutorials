Direct Burning Program
======================

- Of course, if you find the above steps too cumbersome, you can also use Espressif's official flashing tool. We've packaged the program as a bin file, so you can flash it directly to the ESP32 development board without importing libraries or downloading the ESP32 core package, allowing you to experience the kit's features more quickly.


Install CH340 Driver
--------------------

- Similarly, before using Espressif's official flashing tool, you must first install the CH340 driver so that the ESP32 development board can communicate properly with your computer. If the CH340 driver is not installed, please see the CH340 driver installation tutorial page: :doc:`install_CH340`.


Download burning tools

5. Move the downloaded bin firmware file to the bin folder in the previously downloaded and unzipped burning tool directory.


Burning firmware
----------------

1. Connect the ESP32 development board to the computer via a USB cable and make sure the computer can correctly identify the corresponding serial port.

2. Double-click to open the burning tool.

.. note::

   If the flashing process fails, please follow these steps:

   - Confirm that the ESP32 development board is properly connected to the computer via a USB cable and that the CH340 driver is installed.
   - Check that COMx in the flashing tool is the actual serial port number.
   - Confirm that the firmware file is correctly placed in the BIN folder and check the box on the left.
   - Verify the flashing parameter settings: SPI SPEED = 80MHz, SPI MODE = DIO, BAUD = 921600.
   - Try changing the USB cable or USB port to eliminate communication issues.
   - If flashing still fails, restart the computer and development board and try again.
